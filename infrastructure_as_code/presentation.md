# Infrastructure as code
Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a key DevOps practice that involves managing and provisioning computing infrastructure

# Key Concepts

### Automation
IaC automates the provisioning of infrastructure, making the process faster, more repeatable, and less prone to human error.
### Idempotency
An idempotent operation can be performed multiple times without changing the result beyond the initial application. IaC ensures that the same configuration can be applied repeatedly with the same result, enhancing consistency across environments.
### Version Control
With IaC, infrastructure configurations are stored in version control systems. This allows changes to be tracked, reviewed, and rolled back if necessary, improving the reliability and stability of environments.
### Collaboration
IaC facilitates better collaboration among team members by allowing infrastructure setup to be shared and reviewed through code. This improves the efficiency and quality of software delivery.

## Benefits of IaC

- **Speed and Simplicity**: Automated provisioning speeds up the deployment of infrastructure and applications.
- **Consistency and Reliability**: Infrastructure is provisioned consistently, reducing the chances of errors and discrepancies.
- **Scalability and Flexibility**: Easily scale and adapt infrastructure to changing requirements without manual effort.
- **Cost Savings**: Reduces the need for manual intervention, saving time and operational costs.

## IaC Providers

- **Terraform**: An open-source tool by HashiCorp that allows for the provisioning of infrastructure across multiple cloud providers using a declarative configuration language.
- **AWS CloudFormation**: AWS CloudFormation lets you model, provision, and manage AWS and third-party resources by treating infrastructure as code.
- **Ansible**: An open-source tool focused on simple, powerful, and agentless automation. It is particularly well-suited for configuration management.
- **Chef**: A powerful automation platform that transforms infrastructure into code, allowing companies to automate how they build, deploy, and manage their infrastructure.
- **Puppet**: Another open-source tool designed to manage the configuration of Unix-like and Microsoft Windows systems declaratively.
